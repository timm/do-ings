In the 21st century, any programmer should be above to  build "legs" that  can run around data as well as  "brains" that  decide where and when to run.

This combined software engineering/ knowledge engineering approach is not so hard. E.g. this site starts with simple scripting and ends up at data mining.

A list of planned tools follow.
